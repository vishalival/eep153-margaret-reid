   Description of Population of Interest

Population: Inuit peoples living in Nunavut
Inuit is a broad term to refer to the indigenous people of the Arctic (Canada.gov). While Inuit live in many places, including Alaska, Canada, and Greenland, we are focusing on the Inuit people in Nunavut, due to the region’s overwhelming population of Inuit people. Nunavut is part of the Inuit Nunangut, a region self-governed by Inuit (The Canadian Encyclopedia). Nunavut means “Our Land” in the Inuit language, Inuktut, and is the northernmost territory of Canada (Canadian Geographic).  According to the 2021 Nunavut census, 30,865 out of 36,600 people living in Nunavut are Inuit (Statistics Canada).

Inuit were hunter-gatherers throughout history with food consumption patterns corresponding to the season. During these times, traditional foods contributed to the social, cultural and economic parts of the Inuit lifestyle. The traditional diet was mainly protein based, such as fish, caribou, and marine mammals, which were of great importance to the native people for health and culture.  However, the indigenous people have been making the transition from traditional foods to manufactured and imported items such as sweetened beverages and chips (Sharma). 

Description: Food Security, Health, and Diet of Inuit in Nunavut
The minimum cost diet is a pertinent issue for Inuit people in Nunavut. The population struggles with high rates of food insecurity compared to other Canadian regions, health concerns such as diabetes, and also consumes a mix of unique traditional indigenous foods alongside store-bought foods.
While the numbers vary slightly, in Canada, roughly 8.8 percent of households are food insecure (Statistics Canada), but these rates are much higher in Nunavut, where roughly 50 percent of households are food insecure (Household Food Insecurity in Canada). The rates of food insecurity in Nunavut are at crisis levels according to the recent Canadian Community Health Survey. A driver of food insecurity in Nunavut is high costs for store bought foods and difficulty accessing fishing and hunting in the region (Lambden et al. 2006). Food security programs in the area have failed, evident in how insecurity increased by 13.2 percentage points since the Canadian government’s Nutrition North Canada program launched in 2011 (Fafard St.-Germain 2019).
There is a concern that the quick change in diet may negatively affect the Inuit people's health and nutrition, increasing the risk of diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Twenty-eight percent of people in Nunavut, an Inuit self-governing region in northern Canada, are obese, while twenty percent are overweight. Approximately 60% of adult Nunavut residents stated they did not engage in any physical activity (Sharma). Inuit towns in the Canadian Arctic are remote, and they rely mostly on hunting, fishing, and one or two grocery stores for their nourishment. Because they control food prices and availability, grocery shops are consequently a crucial focal point for nutritional interventions. Programs offered by grocery stores may influence consumers' decisions about the foods they buy for their homes at the moment of sale. (Sharma) 
The average Inuit in Nunavut consumes a mix of store bought foods with traditional foods, which includes caribou, beluga, arctic char, muktuk, hare, and wild berries (Table). According to the 2007-2008 Inuit Health Survey in Nunavut, 81 percent of households preferred eating more country foods (traditional hunted and gathered food), and also 76.1 percent viewed country food as cheaper than store-bought food. However, there are barriers to getting food from both sources.


Scope of Diet Problem: Traditional and Non-Traditional Diet Mix
	The goal of our diet problem was to understand the value of traditional foods in the Inuit diet. Identifying the value of traditional foods is a challenge, as these foods are not sold at Western grocery stores. Thus, we had to piece together the consumption and value of traditional foods through key reference papers. 
	Hopping et. al 2010’s paper, “Dietary adequacy of Inuit in the Canadian Arctic” sampled an Inuit community in Nunavut, and found that overall, traditional foods contribute substantially to protein and iron intake, while store-bought foods mainly comprise their carbohydrate, sugar, and fat intake. This paper is important because it gave the percent contribution of both traditional and non-traditional foods to the diets of Inuits in Nunavut. 
	Hopping et. al’s responses were largely women: (75 participants, 7 men and 68 women; average age 42 (SD 19) and 44 (SD 16) for men and women respectively). Due to the sample within Hopping et al. 2010, being largely middle-aged women, we decided to provide as accurate an estimate as possible for our diet problem by focusing on satisfying the minimum cost diet for 31-50 year old females in Nunavut, with the dietary recommendations from the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, which was cited by Ostrager 2015, which described the dietary structure of Inuit communities (Ostrager 2015).
